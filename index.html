            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Versioning Control is having one main repository for all of ones’ files. Working as a team, members will check the files out, make changes and then save them back into the repository. This solves many file sharing problems! A Versioning Control System (VCS) automatically notes: who changed the files, when they were changed, what about them has been changed or added and merge changes to that same file. Files cannot be overwritten so one can revert back to older versions of the file if need be. You can have a local repository for a single user or a remote repository for multiple team members. This topic is interesting to me because it gives a whole new perspective of file managing and sharing. There are so many problems that software like this can resolve. This topic is relevant to the course because we will be using repositories to upload and save our files. If we ever mess up on a file, a backup would have been created and we can revert to a previous version. Also, if we are working with group members, we can keep track of who has done what, and no files will be misplaced or mistakenly overwritten. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a free, open source version control system that allows people to work on files with efficacy and safety. Every user on GIT has a complete copy of the repository data stored locally on their machine. Processes run much faster, and since everything is local, one can work offline. Instead of overwriting files, Git will prevent that by saving previous versions. The basic Git commands are: git init, which initiates the Git. Git add, which adds a new Git, and git commit, sends your info to the repository. Git log and git status is to see who and when files have been modified.  This topic is relevant to the course because we will be using GIT as a repository. We have to know how to upload our files correctly and keep track of them, especially while we are working with others. File sharing can be very complicated, but with this intermediary, large sized file won’t have to be improperly transferred and we can feel safer knowing we won’t lose our work in the process of moving files. Without a safe local or remote repository such as Github, many people would have problems keeping track of their files and previous versions. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git States/Stages</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three states of your Git. The three states are: committed, modified and staged. Committed means that your data is safely stored in your local database. Modified mean that a file had been changed, but has not been committed to your database yet. Staged means that one has marked a modified file, in its current version, to go into your next commit snapshot. During these states, your file is in one of three stages. The first stage is the Git directory. This is where the metadata and object database are stored. The second is the staging area, this stores information about what will go into your next commit. The final stage is the .git directory. This is where the files go after they are committed through the staging area and stores a snapshot permanently to your Git depository.  This is interesting to me because I didn’t think there were so many steps to saving a file. This is relevant to the course because we will be going through these exact steps to transfer our files into repositories safely. Without knowing these steps, we may mess up our data files and we can’t let that happen, as our work depends on a safe repository to be stored in.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Cloning Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Cloning an existing repository is a great way to make sure you have your files backed up, just in case. This clones the whole repository, and all of the files, so you can contribute without overwriting data. Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default when you run git clone. If your server ever gets corrupted, you can use any clone o any client to set your server back to the state it was In when it was cloned. You clone a repository with git clone <url>. This will create a depository and will initiate a .git directory inside of it. It pulls all the data for the repository and checks out a working copy of the latest version. Git has a number of different transfer protocols you can use. This is interesting to me because .git shows that it has multiple ways of saving and restoring files. With this in mind, I can now use Git with more sense of security, knowing that my files can be restored if anything were to happen. This is relevant to the course because if any student ever has a corrupt file, they can revert back to a previous version that they have stored or cloned.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Changes in Repositoryr</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Recording changes to your repository is the safe, surefire way to save your files. Any time the project reaches a state that you want to record, you need to make those changes and take a snapshot of those changes into your repository. Each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or untracked. Files in the last snapshot are Tracked files. They can be modified, unmodified or staged. Everything else are Untracked files – Any files that are not in your staging area and were not in your last snapshot. Git see your files as modified when you edit them because you’ve altered them since the last commit. This is interesting to me because files that are tracked, are the last files and snapshot of files that you have been working on. This relates to our course because we need to remember to record our changes to the repository so we can have correctly updated files, without having to search for files or a certain snapshot of files. To determine what files are at what stage, you need to type the command git status. This will give you the status and the branch on your server. </p>
